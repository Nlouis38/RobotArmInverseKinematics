-   **Purpose:** Calculates the optimal joint angle updates using quadratic programming (QP) optimization, taking joint limits into account.-   **`q_next = cp.Variable(model.nq)`:** Creates a variable representing the next set of joint angles, which will be optimized.-   **`desired_q_change`:** Calculates the desired change in joint angles using a damped least-squares method. This aims to minimize the error between the current and desired end-effector poses.-   **`objective`:** Defines the optimization objective: to minimize the difference between the desired joint angle change (`desired_q_change`) and the actual change (`q_next - q`).-   **`constraints`:** Sets constraints to ensure the joint angles stay within their physical limits.-   **`prob = cp.Problem(objective, constraints)`:** Formulates the QP problem with the defined objective and constraints.-   **`prob.solve(...)`:** Solves the QP problem using the OSQP solver (a fast and robust solver for QPs). The `warm_start=True` option can help speed up convergence.-   **`q = q_next.value`:** Updates the joint angles `q` with the optimal values found by the solver.-   **Progress Reporting:** The `if i % 10 == 0` block prints the current iteration number and the error every 10 iterations, providing feedback on the solver's progress.
